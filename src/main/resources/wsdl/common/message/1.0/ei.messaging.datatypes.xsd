			<documentation>
				Target of the Message. The target attribute is used to
				address a certain port of a service. Ports are directly
				linked to different service providers. Therefore the
				target attribute enables service consumers to address a
				certain service provider, e.g. when a service is
				provided by several local instances. Valid content of
				the target attribute is defined by the static linkage
				defined in CEISeR. Every port of a service gets a unique
				name. The defined port names can be used when calling
				the service. Using an undefined port name results in an
				error as the call cannot be routed. In cases when just a
				single port for a service is available the service
				consumer MAY omit the target. It is then determined
				automatically.

			Correlation-ID of the Message.
			It contains the unique identifier of a specific single instance of a business process (see chapter ?9.1). Ideally this ID is universally
			unique. It SHOULD be considered being an unstructured string and not be interpreted by any application receiving it. An application
			initiating a business process instance MUST set correlationId. There very same ID MUST be used by every single application involved in
			executing this business process instance and sent with every single service request and response or fault. This allows messages to be
			correlated to this particular business process instance. Specifically a server MUST NOT create a new correlationId when sending a
			response or fault or in "nested service calls" belonging to the same business process instance. It MUST use the very same ID it received
			as part of a request. correlationId is used for Business Activity Monitoring, Message Warehouse, debugging and error management.

	<simpleType name="EIMessageRequestId">
		<annotation>
			<documentation>
			Request-ID of the Message.
			If used, it MUST contain a unique identifier. Ideally this ID is universally unique. It SHOULD be considered being an unstructured string and not be interpreted by the service provider. As an interpretation of the content is not possible for the service provider and not all providers are capable of handling the complete UTF-8 character set the character set used for the requestId MUST be limited to plain ASCII.
			requestId is not needed at all and can be omitted in a fully synchronous service usage. For asynchronous service usage the client needs some means to correlate a response to the original request. requestId SHOULD be used to serve this purpose. If a client has some other mechanism to do this correlation, it MAY use it. It is up to service user and service provider to agree on usage of a different mechanism.
			If requestId is used in a service request, the server MUST pass on the very same value received by putting it into the requestId element of the corresponding service response or fault. This way the client receiving the response or fault can associate it correctly with the service request sent previously.
			ESB always forwards a requestId without any interpretation or modification, independently of the MEP used.

	<simpleType name="EIMessageSender">
		<annotation>
			<documentation>
			This element is mandatory and of type EIMessageSender, which is a xsd:string with a length ranging from 2 to 255 and the specific format
			described below. sender identifies the component instance sending a message. It MUST contain an URI of the following format: sndr:
			[{username}@]{component instance}[/{machine}[/{instance}]] The URI MUST contain the component instance. Values for the component SHOULD
			be chosen according to ARM (see reference ?[53]), but will also need to include local or system name elements to make it unique. The
			component instance is needed to determine the correct routing of the services (as this is stored in CEISeR) and to support SCM. sender
			SHOULD also contain the machine name and instance to ease debugging and error management. The URI MAY contain the username of the human
			user who caused the request. This username SHOULD not be used for identity management. It is intended for informational purposes only.
			sender MUST be set for every single message sent. So both a client sending a service request and a server sending a response or fault
			must set sender to a value including their own component name and optionally machine and instance. Internally to the ESB, sender is used
			for Service Contract Management. Without sender properly set, ESB would not be able to control or monitor compliance to service
			contracts.

	<simpleType name="EIMessageReplyTo">
		<annotation>
			<documentation>
			The replyTo attribute is used in the context of asynchronous request/response scenarios.  As no component has a state to store
			correlation or routing attributes in the message itself provides the replyTo field which MUST be returned by the client without
			interpretation. This field is modified by the binding components to store the response queue and the receiving component in it to be
			able to route the response correctly. The service consumer MUST NOT fill this attribute. It is in the responsibility of the service
			provider binding component to ensure that the service provider can understand and store the whole character set used in the replyTo
			field. It SHOULD just contain ASCII characters.

	<simpleType name="EIMessageTimeLeft">
		<annotation>
			<documentation>
			Defines the lifetime of the request in the ESB in milliseconds.
			This element is optional and of type EIMessageTimeLeft, which is a xsd:long. If used, it MUST contain a time interval in milliseconds.
			timeLeft MAY be used to support a timeout mechanism. If a client using a request / response service is not ready to wait longer than a
			specific time for a response, it MAY set timeLeft to define the timeout value. Whenever asked to forward a message with a timeLeft set,
			ESB calculates an expiration time stamp based on the value of timeLeft and the current UTC time. After that point in time passes, ESB
			writes a log entry when and moves the  expired message to a "dead letter queue". Messages with no timeLeft specified or timeLeft set to
			0 will not expire. Servers MAY use timeLeft to determine whether they should process a request or not. If the needed processing time is
			known to be longer than timeLeft, a server could refrain from further processing of the request. timeLeft is handed over to a server "as
			is", not reduced by ESB latency. So it does not exactly reflect the real time left, but it is still an upper limit.

			This element is optional and of type EIMessagePriority, which is an enumeration of xsd:short with values 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.
			If used, it MUST be set to one of the enumeration values. As the ESB is built upon a product that is compliant to the JMS standard,
			priority is supported as described by this standard. JMS defines a ten-level priority value, with 0 as the lowest priority and 9 as the
			highest. In addition clients should consider priorities 0 to 4 as gradations of normal priority and priorities 5 to 9 as gradations of
			expedited priority. JMS does not require a product implementing the standard to strictly implement a priority ordering of messages;
			however, it should do its best to deliver expedited messages ahead of normal messages. Internally ESB defaults to 4 in case no priority
			is explicitly set. A server MAY honour priority.

	         prevents defining a property more than once (same meaning but different spelling) and puts hold
